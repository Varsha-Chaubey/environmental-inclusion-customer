                    Brazilâ€™s Belo Horizonte Central Market is recognized
                    worldwide as a diverse location. There are over 400 stalls
                    here, and you can buy non-perishable items like religious
                    statues and handicrafts as well as produce, organic fruits,
                    meat, dairy, and spices and herbs. Traditionally cooked
                    Brazilian food is also available, with Saturdays marked by
                    the offering of traditional feijoada, Brazilian black bean
                    stew.
